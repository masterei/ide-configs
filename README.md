# 🛠️ IDE Configs

A centralized repository for storing and sharing IDE configuration files across multiple frameworks and technologies. This ensures consistent linting, formatting, and editor behavior for all contributors.

## 🔧 What’s Included

- `.vscode/settings.json` for common editor preferences
- `.vscode/extensions.json` to suggest required extensions
- ESLint and Prettier configuration (if applicable)
- Framework-specific customization

## 🚀 Usage

1. Copy the appropriate folder’s contents (e.g., `expo/`) into your project’s `.vscode/` directory.
2. Optionally copy ESLint/Prettier config files into your project root.
3. Open the project in VS Code — it will suggest installing recommended extensions.
4. Enjoy a consistent coding experience!

## 📦 Frameworks Supported

- **Expo**
- _More coming soon..._ ✍️
  _(Other framework configs will be added when my schedule allows.)_
